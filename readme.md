# Development Instructions

1. Start by cloning the urbit/urbit repository from github.
`git clone git@github.com:urbit/urbit.git`

2. Then, change directory to urbit/pkg.
`cd urbit/pkg`

3. Then, add this repository as a submodule. This is necessary to resolve symbolic
links to other desks, such as base-dev and garden-dev.
`git submodule add git@github.com:uqbar-dao/ziggurat.git ziggurat`

4. To boot your Urbit, run the following command:
`urbit -F zod -B urbit/bin/multi.pill zod`

5. To create a `%zig` desk, run
`|merge %zig our %base`

6. To mount the `%zig` desk to the filesystem, run
`|mount %zig`.

7. Next, remove all the files from the zig directory.
`rm -rf zod/zig/*`

8. Now, copy all the files from our ziggurat repository into the `%zig` desk.
`cp -RL urbit/pkg/ziggurat/* zod/zig/`

9. Commit those files into your Urbit.
`|commit %zig`

10. Now, install the desk in your Urbit, which will run the `%ziggurat` agent.
`|install our %zig`
